The files here are some activities made as a Computer Science student.
These are all for archival purposes and to help out some friends to learn and share code.

## Running The Code
The most basic way to run code is in [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/). However, I use these sites since it requires no installation:

- For C
https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/
- For C++
https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/
- For Python

- For HTML+CSS+JS
