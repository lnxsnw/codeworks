Some of these are for school submission, some of these are for my friends that need help.

# Running The Code
The most basic way to run code is in [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) in Windows, although it is a multiplatform IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment), you can run it anywhere.

However, I use online compilers since they don't need installation:

- Programiz, in C++ (You can change which language to use in their website!):
> https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/

- OnlineGDB, the best all-in one compiler, I guess:
> https://www.onlinegdb.com/

**Online Compilers are Linux-based compilers, some functions will not run, such as those made for Windows.**

# Table of Contents
This is the third time I restructured this repository. Pray I don't change it any further.

I sorted this to follow the order: [DATE CREATED] ==> [#].

It is sorted first by Date Created (YYYY-MM-DD), then sorted by date created in numbers (1,2,3,...)

To speed things up when searching for which is which, consult the table below:


FLAGS | LANGUAGE | DATE CREATED | # | DESCRIPTION
|--|--|--|--|--|
| - | C++ | 2022-07-23 | 01 | Adding 2 numbers
| - | C++ | 2022-07-23 | 02 | Finding the largest number out of the 2 variables
| - | C++ | 2022-07-23 | 03 | Finding the average of 5 numbers
| - | C++ | 2022-07-23 | 04 | Check if the number is even or odd
| - | C++ | 2022-07-23 | 05 | Finding the largest number out of the 5 variables
| - | C++ | 2022-07-30 | 01 | A face made with letters and symbols

| - | C++ | 2022-12-03 | 03 | One-Time-Use Calculator
| - | C++ | 2022-12-03 | 04 | [MIDTERM] Menu, but using numbers only

## Yooooooo, what does FLAGS mean?
1 means Made for Windows. Although it works for others, some things such as clearing the screen will only work on windows. A minor issue.

*more coming soon*

## Delayed Postings
Assume I am lazy, or delaying to clear the plagiarism check, or just entirely forgot to upload the code at some point in time.
